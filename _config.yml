  Hi, I'm Jongwon Kim, a Ph.D. student at the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). My academic interests lie in probabilistic model, including Gaussian processes and Bayesian modeling, along with their applications in areas such as Constrained Bayesian optimization, anomaly detection, and noise filtering. I have a rich experience in collaborating on projects with major companies like Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, POSCO, and KETI. My studies have spanned a variety of topics in industrial management engineering and machine learning. Recently, I have honed my focus on research that emphasizes quality, statistics, and reliability, seeking to contribute significant advancements in these areas.
